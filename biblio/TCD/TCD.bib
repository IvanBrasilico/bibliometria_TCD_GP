A partir da aplicação de um questionário eletrônico junto a participantes de 105  projetos já finalizados, levantou-se as características dos projetos, das empresas e dos próprios participantes. Além disso, capturou-se a percepção dos mesmos em relação aos stakeholders que foram envolvidos, à adoção de práticas de gestão e ao desempenho dos seus respectivos projetos. Os dados foram analisados com o uso da técnica de modelagem de equações estruturais, segundo diferentes modelos, e os resultados evidenciar uma série de relações positivas e significativas entre as variáveis. Pode-se então concluir que sucesso geral dos projetos e pode ser explicado em 52\% pela gestão de stakeholders, de modo especial quando atrelada a uma maior experiência do participante do mesmo. Tais resultados são consistentes com as expectativas do presente estudo e com a teoria, de modo geral.},

"We claim that taking the fluidity stance helps us remember the true meaning of the word potential (potential of harm and help, as well as the potential project outcome). To have a potential is being capable of becoming something that is not yet in existence. This potential is negotiated in the interactions of stakeholders and projects, technologies, and competences."

It is recognized that projects play a pivotal role in the realization of more sustainable business practices and a developing theme in project management research is the relationship between projects and sustainability. As the literature on this topic is evolving, this paper discusses the question whether the growing attention for sustainability in project management research represents a new ‘school of thought’ in project management? The study builds upon earlier work on schools of project management research, in which nine schools were identiﬁed. The question whether sustainability should be considered a new school of project management is answered by deriving the criteria for recognition as a school and performing a structured literature review on a sample of 71 articles on sustainability in project management, taken from the leading academic journals on this topic. As criteria for recognition as a school of project management, the criteria content, community and impact were found. After a content analysis of the articles in the sample, the conclusion is reached that sustainability qualiﬁes a new, distinct and emerging school of thinking in project management. The deﬁning characteristics of this sustainability school are: considering Projects in a societal perspective, having a Management for stakeholders approach, applying Triple bottom line criteria, and taking a Values based approach to projects and project management.},

The research question was How are dimensions of sustainability considered in the decisionmaking processes of project managers in relation to the triple constraint of time, cost and quality? Based on the Q-sort of selected respondents, the study found that the consideration of sustainability principles is underrepresented, compared to the triple constraint criteria. However, the analysis of the individual Q-sorts revealed four distinct perspectives that differ signiﬁcantly in their consideration of sustainability principles and triple constraint criteria.},

Stakeholder opposition has been reported as the main reason for failure in several instances. As such, capturing and addressing of stakeholder inputs is crucial to the success of PPP projects. Stakeholder involvement (SI) is an interdisciplinary domain that spans many disciplines (engineering, sociology, psychology, marketing, etc). The fragmented nature of knowledge in this domain is impeding project managers from leading successful SI programmes. As such, this paper presents a semantic model and taxonomy that represents the key concepts underlying stakeholder involvement in PPP infrastructure projects. The model has the potential to act as a core for knowledge representation, sharing and reuse in the multidisciplinary domain of SI. A portion of the model is implemented in a knowledge-base that can be used to recommend the most suitable set of stakeholder involvement tools to be utilized on a particular project. The recommendations provided by the system can act as a ‘short-list’ of potential tools to the inexperienced SI coordinator.},

Forty two publications are assessed against the purpose of this notion, the stakeholder deﬁnition and how the identiﬁcation of stakeholders is addressed. The analysis shows that only a minority of the publications provides a clear deﬁnition and addresses the identiﬁcation of stakeholders. We argue that a role perspective on the stakeholders issue ﬁts the project context and therefore could ﬁll this gap in the project management literature. After comparing the stakeholder approach with project role classiﬁcations from the literature, we conclude that a role-based stakeholder identiﬁcation method is a promising approach for identifying stakeholders in projects.},

A structured survey questionnaire technique was applied for data collection and 323 responses were received from project management professionals in Pakistan. The results revealed that SPM has a positive impact on project success. However, the effects of stakeholder engagement and team building were found insignificant. Accordingly, this paper contributes to SPM literature by demonstrating the relationship between SPM and project success in a developing world context. From a practical viewpoint, firms need to consider SPM from a holistic perspective by embracing and incorporating key sustainability aspects into various project life-cycle stages. To this end, project managers not only need to promote stakeholder engagement and team-building strategies, but also scrutinize all important project decisions from a sustainability lens to further enhance SPM outcomes and create a meaningful value proposition for each stakeholder group, which are increasingly recognized as critical issues for project success.},

The study takes a pragmatic design science approach in developing these tools and frameworks. The resulting frameworks build upon the concepts of sustainable development and form an elaboration of the documented practices of project stakeholder management.},

"Cleland (1986) introduced stakeholders and stakeholder management processes to the project management canon by highlighting the importance of stakeholder identification, classification, analysis, and management approach formulation" (Littau et al 2010:17)
"During the last few years, many authors stated clearly the extraordinary importance of stakeholders in projects" (Littau et al 2010:17)
"Stakeholder management has become an important soft skill in projects" (Littau et al 2010:17)
"Stakeholder theory has its origins in the year 1984. At that time, Freeman defined stakeholders as "any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organisation's objectives"" (Littau et al 2010:17)
"As more than 25 years have passed since the "year of birth" of stakeholder theory, we want to provide a picture of the research history of stakeholder theory in project management literature" (Littau et al 2010:17)

"By analyzing the cited definitions and their qualitative developments over time, we concluded that the understanding of the term stakeholder is moving toward a more comprehensive and multilateral view. Stakeholders are considered as more important in the context of project management" (Littau et al 2010:18)

"Boddy and Paton (2004) stated, "Stakeholders are individuals, groups or institutions with an interest in the project, and who can affect the outcome." In this definition, we can find both the key terms interest-in and can affect, so this definition falls into the third category" (Littau et al 2010:22)
"We named the interest-ingroup as the Type I definition group, because it is the simplest definition of all three types; the can affect and affected by group as the Type II definition group; and the third category of definition group as Type III." (Littau et al 2010:22)
"Drivers Context of Stakeholder Theory The context of articles concerning the stakeholder notion, according to Research Question 3(a), was derived from the main focus of these articles and their keywords" (Littau et al 2010:23)
"More than two-thirds of the stakeholder articles are in the context of project evaluation or project strategy" (Littau et al 2010:23)

The analysis consists of a stakeholder impact index to determine the nature and impact of stakeholder influence, the probability of stakeholders exercising their influence and each stakeholder’s position in relation to the project—are they proponents or opponents?

"Improving the perceptions of project success" (Davis 2014:191)
"Research question one—evolution of project success" (Davis 2014:192)
"The early 1970s success literature focussed on the operational side, tools and techniques ('iron triangle' of time, cost and quality," (Davis 2014:192)
"The 1980s to 1990s moved from the viewpoint of examining technical aspects of a project to how it related to the client organisation" (Davis 2014:192)
"The literature usually omitted the planning phase and linking a project to strategic management and the organisation" (Davis 2014:192)
"he 1990s to 2000s saw the development of CSF frameworks and the importance of success being dependent on internal and external stakeholders" (Davis 2014:193)
"The 21st Century is developing to be more stakeholder focussed with project success being dependent on the project life cycle" (Davis 2014:193)
"This century sees projects being defined by more than just the project manager as stakeholder expectations need to be" (Davis 2014:194)
"managed. There is a focus towards stakeholder satisfaction and a move towards examining the project owner's perception of success." (Davis 2014:194)
"The importance of senior management commitment throughout the project was reiterated as being crucial to provide the link between the organisational mission and project objectives." (Davis 2014:194)
"Research question two—identified stakeholders in the literature when defining project success" (Davis 2014:194)
"It was identified that there was a theme to empirically study the project manager, the client and the user/end user/consumer. There were also more references for stakeholders involved directly in a project (project manager, project team, client, contractor, users, customer, project sponsor or owner) and fewer references for those considered indirectly involved in a project (director, engineer, executive, external environment, external influences, internal and external management, investor, line manager, organisation, other interested parties, suppliers, owner, project executive, project leader, public, senior management, supporters and top management)." (Davis 2014:194)
"There were also limited studies examining the impact/ perception of success from a senior management point of view, including top management, owners and company director, yet the majority of studies stated that top management support is essential to project succes" (Davis 2014:194)

"Conclusions" (Davis 2014:198)
"5.1. Research question one" (Davis 2014:198)
"A background literature review examined how success has been described over time. It was noted that the 1970s examined the technical aspects of a project at implementation stage and omitted focus on communication with customers. The 1980s to 1990s saw a move away from this, to look at how the project related to the client organisation. This produced lists of uncategorised success factors which started to recognise the importance of how the project manager and project team" (Davis 2014:198)
"viewed success. The 1990s to 2000s started to develop CSF frameworks and the recognition of involvement from internal and external stakeholders. The 21st Century is developing to be more stakeholder focussed, examining success and shorter term project life cycle goals. There is also a move to recognise the involvement of the owner/sponsor and the need for senior management commitment when describing success." (Davis 2014:198)
"However, authors still recognise that success is rarely evaluated across multiple stakeholder groups, as the emphasis tends to be on the perception of project managers." (Davis 2014:198)
"authors were building on Pinto and Slevin's (1987) success factors as opposed to creating original factors, which implies that current literature views these factors as adequate without the need for further research." (Davis 2014:198)
"Four main themes were identified regarding success; Project, Stakeholders, Organisation and External." (Davis 2014:198)
"The'Project features' theme highlighted that planning was linked to success, whereas current literature omitted to examine project success linked to post project learning" (Davis 2014:198)
"The'Project objectives' theme revealed two categories linked to setting objectives: planning and post project. This failed to examine objectives throughout the implementation stage." (Davis 2014:198)
"There was, however, consensus in the literature that time, cost and quality are important when defining success criteria" (Davis 2014:198)
"The'Stakeholder' theme illustrated the need to define roles and responsibilities and have continual communication between stakeholders." (Davis 2014:198)
"5.2. Research question two" (Davis 2014:199)
"The thematic analysis of the literature evidenced the project manager as the most highly cited stakeholder when measuring project success. There was a theme to empirically study project manager, client and user/end user/consumer. It was noted that the more senior a role in an organisation, the less research has been undertaken, identifying a gap in the literature for empirical work. The author suggests further clarification of stakeholder groups and investigation into the understanding of project success by different stakeholder groups." (Davis 2014:199)
"5.3. Research question three" (Davis 2014:199)
"In answering research question three, the thematic analysis revealed that client and user had the most in common in perceiving project success, recognising five success factors. These were: communication, time, stakeholder satisfaction, makes use of finished product/acceptance and cost/budget. There were four success factors in common between the project manager and user/ client (communication, time, stakeholder satisfaction and cost/ budget). It was found that there were fewer success factors in common between project manager and sponsor/owner and there was only one success factor in common between those in senior management (sponsor, owner) and those at the client/user level (project recipient). The main issue highlighted was that, for some groups, there were no success factors in common, which were all linked to the senior management level" (Davis 2014:199)},

Findings – The research is centred around this tool, the stakeholder circle, as a means to provide a useful and effective way to visualise stakeholder power and influence that may have pivotal impact on a project's success or failure. The stakeholder‐circle tool is developed for each project through a methodology that identifies and prioritises key project stakeholders and then develops an engagement strategy to build and maintain robust relationships with those key stakeholders. An example of the tool is presented. Originality/value – Future papers will provide case study examples currently under way of the use of this tool.

"To clarify some ambiguities related to the scale of project success, Lim and Mohamed (1999) argue that there are two possible viewpoints: macro-level success and micro-level success" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:228)
"Usually the end users and project beneficiaries are the ones looking at project success from the macro viewpoint." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:228)
"The micro viewpoint concerns the construction parties such as consultants and contractors." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:228)
"micro success pertains to traditional triangle" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:228)
"macro success is more concerned about the eventual operation/functions or long-term gains of the project" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:229)
"ookie-Davies (2002) also offers a distinction between project success - which is measured against the overall objectives of the project - and project management success - which is measured against the widespread and traditional measures of performance against cost, time, and quality." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:229)
"Cookie-Davies (2002) also highlights the difference between the success criteria and success factors. Success factors are those which contribute to achieving success on a project. On the other hand, success criteria are the measures by which the success or failure of a project will be judged. Factors constituting the success criteria are commonly referred to as the key performance indicators or KPIs." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:229)

"to investigate if the perception of KPIs differs across: a. various construction stakeholders, b. firms working independently and in joint ventures, and c. various levels of professionals' overall experience and experience as project managers" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:229)
"researchers suggest that in addition to the measures of iron triangle, customer satisfaction (Pinto and Slevin, 1988) and overall satisfaction of stakeholders (Bryde and Brown, 2005) should also be considered in performance evaluation criteria." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:229)
"Freeman and Beale (1992) reveals that five most frequently used criteria to measure project success include: technical performance, efficiency of execution, managerial and organizational implications, personal growth and manufacturer's ability and business performance."

"Cox et al. (2003) differentiates between quantitative and qualitative measures of success" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:230)

"Qualitative performance indicators of Cox et al. (2003) include safety, turn-over, absenteeism, and motivation" (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:230)
"In the current study, an attempt is made to capture the perception of construction project leaders about a mix of different quantitative and qualitative KPIs for large-scale public sector development projects." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:230)
"Ranking of various KPIs was obtained by computing the means for the overall sample as well as for separate groups of stakeholders." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:232)
"Since the Airport was targeted to be opened in September 2005, high ranking of 'on time' is not unexpected." (Toor and Ogunlana 2010:232)
"There are some noticeable differences between the rankings of KPIs across various stakeholders. For example, 'on-time' (KPI1) is high on the agenda of all stakeholders. 'Under budget' (KPI2) is generally given a priority by all except the client. 'Efficiently' (KPI4) is a main concern for the client and project management consultants whereas 'safety' (KPI6) seems to be more important for design consultants and construction contractors."
